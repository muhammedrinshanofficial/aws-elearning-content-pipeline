The following is a raw speech-to-text transcript of an instructional video,
in {language_code}. The transcript may contain minor transcription errors,
filler words, repeated phrases, or occasionally a rough/garbled patch where
the transcription model mis-heard a word or phrase - use context to work
around any such rough patches rather than treating them literally.

If the transcript is not already in English, translate the content into
English as you write the notes - the final output must be entirely in
English regardless of the source language.

Produce the study notes in this exact structure, using Markdown formatting:

# <A short, descriptive title for the video's topic>

## Summary
<A 2-4 sentence overview of what the video covers>

## Key Topics
<For each major topic discussed, a "### <topic name>" heading, followed by
2-5 bullet points covering the important points made about that topic, in
the order they were discussed>

Write only the study notes themselves - no preamble, no meta-commentary
about the transcript, no closing remarks.
